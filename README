Multiproxy:
  A simple multithreaded proxy request server.

Build:
  There is a simple Makefile located int the root of the project. To build the 
  code simply run: make

Run:
  To start multiproxy, there are two command line parameters. The port you wish 
  to run on, and the directory where your static files live:
  
  * ./multiproxy 8080 /home/user/src/multiproxy/html

  There are three proxy endpoints statically defined:

  * A -> http://localhost:8080/test1.html
  * B -> http://localhost:8080/test2.html
  * 3 -> http://localhost:8080/test3.html

  Since these run on port 8080, its recommended to run multiproxy on the same
  port. The test files listed above are located in the html directory of the
  multiproxy folder.
